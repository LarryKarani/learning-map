# D2 iOS Developer Track

## Role Description
_“What does someone in this role do?”_

A Mid-Level (D2) iOS Developer is responsible for building assigned features, performing maintenance tasks, and testing and refactoring their own code as well as the code of more junior teammates. They are expected to be able to produce quality, working code with less supervision than a D1/Junior Developer. 

A Mid-Level iOS Developer is still assigned tasks by a team lead, but should have a very clear understanding of how their work fits into the bigger picture of the team and company. In addition, they are expected to take more ownership of these tasks than a Junior Developer would, ensuring that their features are performance optimized, secure, and written with the proper code structure or architecture. 

A Mid-Level iOS Developer is very comfortable building a moderately sized app from scratch, leveraging the appropriate tools, networking, and architecture to do so. An example of a mid-level application would be the equivalent of writing the Andela Pulse App from scratch.
