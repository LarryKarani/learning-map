# 06- Protocol-Oriented Programming

### Skill Description
A person with this skill knows the benefits and drawbacks of protocol-oriented programming, and implements it in their application at appropriate times to enhance code reusability. 

----- 

### Knowledge 
*What information do I need to learn?*
- **Knowledge:** How to set up a the properties and functions in a protocol that can be used by many classes
- **Knowledge:** How protocol-oriented programming works as an alternative to the normal class inheritance patterns

### Behavior 
*How do I apply this information in context?*
- **Behavior:** When I know that I will have multiple inheritance, I use protocol-oriented programming. 
- **Behavior:** After I have created a protocol, I conform as many classes as I want to it. 

### Belief 
*How does an expert think about this skill?*
- **Belief:** Protocols are a bigger deal in Swift than in Objective-C.
- **Belief:** Protocol-oriented programming can be incredibly powerful-- but it can also make it hard understand what is happening in your code.
