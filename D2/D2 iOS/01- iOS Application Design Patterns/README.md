### Behavior 
*How do I apply this information in context?*
- **Behavior:** When I am building a very simple app from scratch, I use MVC for its simplicity.
- **Behavior:** When I have a more complex app, I use MVVM+C to ensure I can reuse components
- **Behavior:** When I need to separate  out my business logic from the presentation logic, I use MVVM or VIPER. 
- **Behavior:** When I want to be able to reuse my screens and view controllers flexibly, I use MVVM over MVC.
