# 02- Networking & Working with APIs

### Skill Description
A person with this skill is comfortable building an application that consumes the API for a network service from scratch. 

### Optional Project
Write a client for a REST network service. A great one to use is GitHub’s API. Build an application that interacts with the information available in the API. 

-----
### Knowledge 
*What information do I need to learn?*
- **Knowledge:** How a URL Session works “behind the scenes”
- **Knowledge:** How to fetch data from an API endpoint 
- **Knowledge:** How to transform data to and from JSON
- **Knowledge:** CocoaPods that you can use for networking components, and when to use them

### Behavior 
*How do I apply this information in context?*
- **Behavior:** After I am confident that I can write a network service client and work with API endpoints from scratch, I can then leverage CocoaPods such as AlamoFire or Moya.
- **Behavior:** When I use AlamoFire or Moya, I am introducing a third-party dependency into my app.

### Belief 
*How does an expert think about this skill?*
- **Belief:** I should not use a networking services CocoaPod or other networking abstraction until I know how such abstractions work “under the hood”
