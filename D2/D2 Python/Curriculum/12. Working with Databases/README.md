# Working with Databases

## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to become acquainted with the fundamentals of Relational Databases and the Relational Model, learn how 
to connect to a database and then interact with it by writing basic SQL queries, both in raw SQL as well as with SQLAlchemy, 
which provides a Pythonic way of interacting with databases.

# Output:

**Task:** Implement the following tasks:
* Create a database
* Write a program to access the database
* Write short programs that execute complex SQL queries that will enable you interact with your data in powerful ways.
* Create a mini ORM using Python and SQL to show the CRUD operation.
